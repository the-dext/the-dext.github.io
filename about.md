Hi, I'm Chris Dexter a software developer based in the UK with over 25 years of professional experience in software engineering. 

Over the course of my career I've worked in all company sizes from small software houses to global enterprises and in a variety of different domains from financial to education and security and currently retail.
I've used many different technologies, frameworks and programming languages. But most recently C#, Angular, MongoDB and GraphQL.

I'm deeply passionate about Domain Driven Design, TDD and Agile and using these skills to help businesses grow.
I believe it's just as important to create maintainable solutions as it to deliver on customer requirements. Customers should be left with solutions that they can take forward as their business evolves and grows, not just solve their needs today.

I'm experienced in creating well structured monolithic applications, micro-service architectures and applying Domain Driven Design techniques to migrate from monoliths to micro-services.
