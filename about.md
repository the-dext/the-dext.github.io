Hi, I'm Chris Dexter a software developer based in the UK with almost 30 years of professional experience in software engineering. 

Over the course of my career I've worked with companies of various sizes, from small software houses to global enterprises.
These companies have spanned a variety of domains including 
* Bespoke Software Solutions
* Financial Services
* Education
* Security & Critical Infrastructure
* Consumer Retail

I'm deeply passionate about Domain Driven Design, Test Driven Development and Agile methodologies which I use on a daily basis.

I'm experienced in creating well structured software solutions including they are monolithic applications, micro-service architectures and also in  applying Domain Driven Design techniques to help businesses migrate from monoliths to micro-services. 

I believe it's just as important to create maintainable software as it to deliver working software, and that software engineers have a responsibility to deliver solutions that businesses can take forward as their needs evolve.

Currently I am working as a Principal Software Engineer at Nimble Approach, a software consultancy based in the north of England. If you would like to explore how Nimble Approach can help your business check out their [website](https://www.nimbleapproach.com) and please mention that you found them via my blog.
